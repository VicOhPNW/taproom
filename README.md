# Taproom

##### React exercise By Victoria O., Epicodus - November 16, 2018

## *Description*
_Taproom_ is a simple web app exercise to:
1. Apply and test our understanding of React unit week 1 lessons (see "Primary Objectives" below).
2. Compare the difference in development process between Angular and React (see "Thoughts" below).

Primary Objectives:
* Development environment is fully-functional, including Babel transpiling, Webpack module bundling, a development server with hot module replacement, and linting.
* Components are used to create modular UI elements.
* propTypes define data types and shapes for all component props.
* Application successfully uses client-side routing via the React-Router library to create appearance of multiple pages.
* Styles are successfully added using CSS objects.
* State is used only when necessary.
* State is lifted in an efficient manner that follows best practices.
* Documentation accurately represents current component/state structure of application.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

Thoughts:
Add a notes section where you document unforeseen issues and questions during your development process. Commit these notes by themselves.
In your description of the project include thoughts on the difference in development process in Angular and React.
